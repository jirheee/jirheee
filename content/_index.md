I'm Jungin, a Phd candidate in [Concurrency and Parallelism laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST, advised by [Jeehoon Kang](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/jeehoon.kang/).
My research current interest lies in hardware design and programming languages, and thereby building better tools for easier hardware design, aiming to bridge the gap between complex hardware and intuitive programming.

Other then my research, I spend my time doing workouts at gym, running, playing guitar of singing, and [writing](/posts).

Here, I'll be documenting my journey through my PhD, delving into my research, and sharing thoughts on life inside and outside academia.


<!--I enjoy working on [projects](/projects) that challenge me and allow me to learn things, whether it's writing a [kernel driver with Rust](/posts/kernel-driver-with-rust/), reverse engineering and deobfuscating anticheats, or building a flashcard generator with LLMs. I also enjoy sharing that knowledge by [writing blog posts](/posts) and [speaking at meetups and conferences](/talks).-->
