I'm Jungin, Phd candidate in [Computer Architecture and Systems Lab](https://casyslab.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST, co-advised by [Jongse Park](https://jongse-park.github.io) and [Jeehoon Kang](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/jeehoon.kang/).
My research interest lies in between hardware design and programming languages, aiming to bridge the gap between complex hardware and intuitive programming.

Other then my research, I like to run, work out at gym, play guitar, sing, and [write blog posts](/posts).

Here, I'll be documenting the journey throughout my PhD, delving into my research, and sharing thoughts on life inside and outside academia.


<!--I enjoy working on [projects](/projects) that challenge me and allow me to learn things, whether it's writing a [kernel driver with Rust](/posts/kernel-driver-with-rust/), reverse engineering and deobfuscating anticheats, or building a flashcard generator with LLMs. I also enjoy sharing that knowledge by [writing blog posts](/posts) and [speaking at meetups and conferences](/talks).-->
