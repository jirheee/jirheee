The Emotional Swell: Anxiety, Stress, and Moving Forward
Throughout this entire process, managing my personal anxiety about intractable problems was incredibly challenging.

Firstly, there was anxiety about the significance and value of my research.
Questions like "Is my research meaningful? Will reviewers empathize with this problem? Is it okay to submit a POPL paper without a formal proof?" plagued me.
I overcame this by trusting my professor.
He has successfully completed far more research than I have, and I deeply respect him as a researcher.
Deciding to trust his judgment and guidance brought a clear direction.
Once the path was clear, I could focus on rapidly iterating on implementation, experiments, and the paper itself.

Secondly, there was anxiety about my own capabilities.
"Can I actually finish a paper? Do I have the ability to write persuasively? Am I simply not good enough, or too lazy?"
These self-critical thoughts would creep in.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly how I overcame this, but I tried my best to stay in the lab for as long as possible.
I minimized travel time and tried to create an environment where I could deeply immerse myself in writing and research.

Thirdly, anxiety about my collaborators weighed heavily on me.
The dread of Minsung's experiments not being finished until the last week, and Jaewoo's writing not being done until the last day, was immense.
In these situations, I continuously checked on their progress and tried to help with anything I could.
What I found truly important was to consistently express gratitude to them and to frame my communications in a way that wouldn't be perceived as aggressive.
I realized that anger wouldn't solve these kinds of problems.
